### Introduction

So my name is Dwayne Codling I am a front-end develonpmper at JH I've been doing frontend for the last three years and before becoming a front-end I was a lecturer Nottingham College for three years so you never know.

My arrival in the tech industry was not a traditional one no CS degree here. I like my place within the tech industry doing front-end I love it something that I actually love going to work to and love building stuff and I think if I can have some way of doing some type of things where I'm helping people on a day to day basis then I'm happy so I think that role suits me well.

### Diversity Vs. Inclusion

So the talk is on Diversity Vs. Inclusion versus inclusion and the reason I am doing the talk is because I am a Black man and maybe it would come across better if there was someone white standing up here talking about Diversity but you know.

I think I wanted to represent what I as an individual face on a day to day, not only that but what I see in the industry and what I have researched and hopefully you know I can actually spread the word and give some advice to companies in order how to get people from more diverse backgrounds I mean people from different, black, ethic minorities, different cultures, asians, different races, creed, classes within the Industry.

I don’t care, we just need to get more of a mix within this industry and I just feel strongly about that so this talk is literal done just to make sure I am helping people. I am helping companies that have some way of going towards having more of people from different races within their company and it’s not only represented by one race. So this is where the talk comes in. So Let’s get straight in to it.

### Generational Wealth Gap?

> So somewhere done the line if you had your family owned a home that was worth ten thousand pounds maybe in another hundred years it might be worth 10 million pounds

Now let's start from a start so the generational wealth gap so anybody know what the generational wealth gap is so it's very interested because the way generational wealth happens is that your dad would have inherited some an inheritance from his dad and then prior to that is that would have inherited some inheritance that could be in the form of land, money, car something of value could be a painting or whatever and over the years the way especially if is land. 

---

the way land works is like if you own a piece of land now and say with economy going up or whatever the land appreciates in value if economies go up or it could depreciate in value if the economy contacts, the majority of time it goes up in value.

So somewhere done the line if you had your family owned a home that was worth ten thousand pounds maybe in another hundred years it might be worth 10 million pounds just for just for the way of talking about generational wealth so but I want to take it a little bit further and this is why I'm gonna take a little further so you know you understand what generation of what it is let's take back a bit further.

So let's put yourself back to 1865 in America so any needs expire in America something happened the slaves were free so if you were a black person that was working on a plantation you were free and when you got freedom, you're a free man no but obviously you want you have no power or or any kind of influence in society so the one thing that the person the freed slaves in America asks for to get feel like they could they could start off at the starting blocks and maybe be able to catch up with their white counterpart was to get some land so they asked for land from the president of a time that was Lincoln and he said okay I promise you you get some land and that will help you guys to build.

in order to build in society to get back to a point where black and white might become the same on equal footing it would be equality and stuff like that now what happened was very tragic because President Lincoln died and that promise was never fulfilled so the successive President Lincoln was Andrew Jackson and when he came into power he basically revoke that promise because he had a lot of pressure from white plantation owners who did not want to give any slave, ex-slave I should say land to make them feel like they were equal in society.

### £792,000,000

So slavery was a very profitable economy when it comes to the economy it was very profitable so anybody that was a white plantation owner became a millionaire and especially in America it sprouted millionaires, most millionaires in the southern states than any other commodity of these days, if you were dealing in slavery you were rich and now those southern states they actually became the economic engine that actually run the United States so if you were a slave owner from the southern states you had privileged to you had influence. if you just were a person that had slaves and had a stake running in the plantation industry.

So know everybody will be saying that was in America, we are in the UK, so what does that have to do with us, we never had slaves in England and you might be right but guess what there was loads of people that live in England that had slaves in the colonies and this is what happened between 1632 to 1807 (nearly 200 years) Britain slave merchants made a profit of 12 million pounds on the purchase and sale of African people.

So if there were selling selling them to America they were making money if they were selling them to the colonies they were making money and believe it or not they were slave ports in England where people were transferred slaves to the colonies, Namely form Liverpool and Bristol in England they transfer slaves to different places in the so not only America but other British Colonies, that were apart of the British Empire and there are different places where people in living in England own slaves in these colonies and profited from the plantation system.

So if you think about 12 million that's what the figure is on the board so 12 million in today's money it's nearly a billion dollars, are you like amaze, so believe it or not so if your fore fathers of any kind had any kind of business back in the days dealing with slavery and that money that gets passed on from generation to generation to generations, just think about the start you would have had what backing you have come in to life with. Contrast that to a black person that forefather where slaves and stated with nothing, it’s like starting a race with Usain Bolt and being shoot in the foot at the starting line you have no hope of competing.

I've done it in a way where I want you to think that if you go white because you've always been in power because it's always been somebody that is white in Power, it's always been somebody white that's passing in the law for somebody that is white, the majority of the society predominantly as you know is catering to somebody that is white.

I mean mainstream caters to somebody that is white, the tech industry now even though it's been around short period of time especially like internet only been around for the last thirty years, the majority of people are at the higher level within the industry are white, so if you think about that the generational wealth gap between somebody that has so much behind them so much influenced so much power behind them compared to a person that’s black.

### The influence of white culture on the mainstream

it's fascinating when you think about that because if you think about the influence of all of somebody that is white and depiction of white culture in the mainstream compared to black culture within mainstream you know that there is a distinct gap between programs on TV that caters to somebody who’s from somebody that is from a minority background.

Plus there is so much institutional prejudice that has arise because of that and because bills were made into laws and you know all of these different parliaments that go through and the majority of people cater for people that look like them and it's just the case where we've come to this and somebody from black or minority ethnic group is still fighting have some type of equality and even within the technique industry, we are still fighting to have that type of equality which if you think about it it's crazy I mean it's 2020 are we still talking about this but yeah we're still talking about this because we still need to talk about this so let's talk about.

### Nottingham Tech Scene

So the Nottingham tech, the tech industry Nottingham would you consider it to be diverse? A lot of people would say yes because we have a lot of of meet-ups that you know cater for people from different areas of tech, and we have women in tech and we have loads of different projects that are ongoing, we have project functions which talk about helping somebody from underprivileged backgrounds towards coming into tech, so we have lots of initiatives in place where we're trying to get people from that type of cultures into the tech industry so Nottingham looks like we okay, you think so let's see.

So the tech industry in Nottingham when somebody says diverse and I and I will say this most people when they talk about the tech industry being diverse, it’s all about I've hired a white woman to fit this role and because we've hired two white women and we have 10 other white male that work in the office we have a diverse business.

We're diverse that's what people say when they're in Nottingham and I've seen it myself I've commented on it you can see go check my Twitter feed it is a case where people of this mindset when they talk about diversity, is that you have you have white females working in the tech industry but it's not a black female or Asian female or a Chinese female are somebody from a different minority ethnic group is somebody that is white and for me as a black person looking in.

I'm looking for somebody that looks as a representation of me I cannot see that, I don't see that that white female as diverse that she might be for somebody that is white she's not diverse enough for somebody that is black and all powers to somebody that is hiring a female, I’m all for it but I'm just thinking that we could do better, we can do some more when it comes to other people from diverse ethnicity as well.

Because the reality is that, that’s what people call diverse when I don't think they should Because for me you know women in tech I'm gonna say this it's mostly white women in tech and it's really bad to say that what is the truth it's like if you think about it it's like the most people that get hired and when you are getting hired look like everybody else I've been working in that company and the majority of people that are working in the tech industry now even in Nottingham that has a multitude of mixed and diverse ethnic groups as is a mixed diverse city, the multitude of people that get hired into the industrial are white, now how can we say we are making products and services and representing society within tech if that is the case.

### Tech Community vs Our Society.

Now this is what I am talking about look at the tech community versus our society, look at the majority of kids born now or mixed race, my kids are mixed race, the majority of families that you see are all mixed you have so many different cultures within the city but compare that to the tech industry within Nottingham.

I won't show it but you can look look at the different companies and look at the people that work at these companies look up their Instagram photos for their for their Christmas party look look up their Instagram post for their for their team meetings where they are showing all of these zoom call photos of the entire company, predominantly white and that's just what it is that's just what it is now if we thinking about building a tech community that truly represents our society if we're thinking about building a tech industry that represents our society that is contrary that is complete opposite to what the society is diversity for me means having different opinions from different people of all shades colour and abilities that's what diversity means.

### Ignorance is a real thing!

Some people say you know you just ignorant and it's the case where you know empathy you can empathise with somebody else and you can you can get similar feelings, you can understand where somebody's coming from and I understand lot of people say no I don't see colour you know somebody white, somebody black it means nothing to me it's all the same it's all about the person and the individual it's not about the colour of their skin and I get that I get that.

Oh yeah but in the rest assure ignorance is a real thing, I mean there's a certain level of knowledge you can never attain.

Example, look I was born black and I will never have knowledge of what it is like to be white ,never, the opposite is also true though you know if you are a born white you will never fully understand what it is to be black.

But how does one gained some understanding from somebody else, it's about having conversations it's about asking, it's about researching, it's about learning. You might never be empathetic towards somebody if you don't have an vested interest in that person to begin with

In order for you to have a vested interest you have to have these conversations, we have to talk for you to know, how I feel as a black man working in the tech industry, plus you have to talk to other people from other cultures for them to know where you are coming from, so in order to do this thing where we are going to try to make this a better industry we first have to start from the ground up.

### Look at things through different lenses.

So firstly we need to be looking at things with different lenses we need to invite diversity and inclusivity into our workplace and we need to be promoting diversity in these ways in the tech industry. We need diversity and we need inclusivity. The tech industry need people to help them look through different lenses in oder to change the response to different problems we face, we have loads of problems that we go through on a day to day and it's important that we are different people from different backgrounds, culture, ethnic groups involve in order to help to fix these issues.

The tech industry is booming at the minute I mean look at it zoom is booming, ecommerce is booming, we in a lock down and yet I'm here being able to do this talk where I'm trying to give you a point of view because I'm working in the tech industry. But if we don't have buy-in if we don't have the bye in of everybody in the society, when feelings change and things move on and there's no longer an appetite for it our industry will fail.

The only way to guarantee that our industry doesn't fail is that we need to have everybody and I mean everyone we need to have people from different cultures, different ethnic group in the industry solving the problems that industry face in order to make it better and we need to be building a community that truly represents our society because these are the people that we are actually selling these product to, these are the people that we're making product and services for so we should in theory have that representation within our workplaces.

### How can we do better?

You might ask yourself how can we do better, there was a saying folks you to say to me growing up and I firmly believe in it “it takes a community to raise a child” and what that means is that we need to give a bit of our time and to invest in the industry.

What we need to be thinking about is saying to yourself “we need to be planting these seeds yeah that we will never, I mean that we will never see become trees.

What I mean by this is that we need to be doing things that we don't need to be seen the benefits from straight away but long-term we know it has the potential to bloom into something great and I will stomp it on for you.

### So this is Mel,

This is Mel and her daughter so Mell was introduced to me about a year ago about no year and a half ago and what what I what she wanted was to get into the industry long story she was a college student she this is her second skint at college.

The first time she left was because she felt pregnant she got married and you know a lot of things happen but kind of what kind of what kind of drive her was the fact that she felt like she was in a situation where not a lot of people thought that she would have been able to become somebody.

She felt like the tech industry, web development is what she specialized in, was something she could actually do, she had a quick brain she felt like she could learn a lot, she’s was a bit rough around the edges but she felt like if she put the time in because she was read about a lot of people that has self-learn she could get there and all she needed was a mentor to push her along and that's what she asked me to do.

Now the only thing I had to do was to give her one hour of my time on a week-to-week basis one of my Lodge and I met up with her and I basically spoke to her about what she was working on look at her work gave her critique and told her how to do better and then she came back showed me how she did it better and it was ongoing until a point where she finished uni she applied for a job she got a job in the industry at Adtrack.

This is Mel now, Mel has literally gone skyrocketed to the point now where she is in the industry mentoring others telling them all how to get into the industry it was something that she dreamt of and because she felt like she could with a helping hand, she has achieved it.

She's at the point where she wants to do the same for other people she's working in the industry and her daughter looks up to her and copies her mom in everything she does and there's a potential there for a daughter to become somebody in this industry because she sees her mom as a role model as somebody that looks like her that is not just a white woman working in the tech industry but somebody from a minority ethic background that possibly her daughter could actually come and do the same thing her mom does.

And this is what I mean by planting seeds that you will never see become tress the potential for daughter to become something because of her mom doing this is great and that's what I think we need to do more of.

### “Diversity is a cornerstone of winning teams”

Diversity is the cornerstone of winning teams I'll give you a scenario you are asked employ somebody there are two candidates, one candidate white you have met before you're aware of that person work ethic and there's some familiarity the next person black has a good, CV good education but you're not sure how they fit into your team culture who do you hire.

See this is the questions? You know if the workplace was truly a representing of the society that you make products for, then your team meetings your Christmas party, would look like what society looks like but it doesn't I've looked at them I've seen your Instagram posts I've seen all of those Christmas parties I've seen your all company calls and the majority of people working in the tech industry are white, there’s a distinct shape of black and colour missing from these pictures that represent the industry.

For your company to have the best chance of winning it should embrace diversity and inclusion and as you embrace diversity and inclusion approach it as a team sport talent acquisition should act like the backup point guard in basketball or attacking midfielder in football setting up and feeding teammates so they can succeed and more importantly so the whole team can succeed that was a quote from Rosana Durrutthy she is the Vice President, Global Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging at LinkedIn and it's quite striking because she's from a black background.

I saw this interview that she gave and she spoke about this and she posted video of a little black girl black was hugging this female developer because she was saying I cannot believe that you're the head of this massive company and you look just like me, that sent shockwaves through my body because it is so important for somebody that look like me to be out here giving a talk because what it does is that somebody coming up can see this and can feel like they can be a part of something that I'm a part of.

### “Don’t Focus on visual appearance Focus on the agenda”

Don't focus on visual appearance focus on the agenda that's a quote from me, ask yourself who are your clients and customers, what do they look like who sits in the office who makes these websites who makes these products, do they look the same?

I have been personally told by someone that I treat everyone the same I don't see colour or race that person was white, my rebuttal is simple if you could change your race to be black would you, do you think there is no such thing as race or you just don't see colour.

Having people in our industry with varied knowledge and varied points of view is ideal as it represents your society, market and the world, let people be who they are without fear of being marginalised. There is a severe lack of accessibility for blacks and minority ethnic groups in the tech industry but there is no overwhelming concerns and it doesn't affect the majority of people working in the industry why should it be somebody else lack of representation affects you personally when you never understand what it means to be black guess the same way I will never understand what it is to be white.

Even if I don't understand truly as I was not born white the representation of what is to be white is overly subscribe in our industry and our society at large, do people know what white privilege is when you are accustom to something all your life do you see it as a privilege there is more than one way of being black and I'll tell your story.

I grow in Jamaica there were different shades of black in Jamaica the majority of the population would be considered to be black but if your skin tone was lighter you were given preferential treatment and was seen as above others. When I was growing up the Prime Minister look like a white man but he govern a country that was distinctly black, I never grew up thinking I could become the Prime Minister because that's what I saw and that was in Jamaica, but somebody is saying to me that in England were the predominantly population his white I do not see colour everybody is the same I see color everybody is not the same.

There’s a lot that you don't understand a lot of people dont understand what privileges is. I’ll let you know first time you don't lose your white privilege when you don't understand what it is. I don't want you to feel bad about being white the same I don't want to feel uncomfortable for being black but I'm gonna critique our industry as a part of my job because having somebody from a different point of view critiquing the work you do and showing your flaws in the position that you are and give me giving you feedback is a positive thing it's a good thing that will help to change this industry and this is why I'm doing this I'm not critiquing you in a negative way I'm critiquing you with a hope that this will bring positive changes.

### Create &amp; Accelerate Opportunities

Create and accelerate opportunities, Create opportunities and accelerate these opportunities for others we know white is the default mode but dark mode is sweet it saves batteries , it’s easier on the eyes at night having an option to switch it's not a bad thing, being different is not a bad thing, it leads to discovering approaches and thinking outside the box from the default choice to solve problems.

Sacrificing something for a greater good is not a bad thing it leads to enlightenment, teach yourself above everyone else that is not white there's a tonne of literature you can stop don't see colours or they are no prejudices or there's no racism that’s just being ignorant and is because you don’t have a more diverse view of the world.

if you continue to look at the headlines or you continue to look at your social media feed or your YouTube algorithm, this is not reality, in reality the world is made up of different races and different individuals with different beliefs we all breathe the same air and use the resources the earth provides in order to live. it would be ideal for you to have some more conversation with somebody that is not just from your clique of people that you go out with on a day-to-day and not the same skin colour that you are and understand their culture and their backgrounds and beliefs.

### Stories &amp; Drive

Stories and drive should be used evaluate how it fits your company agenda. Gender equality versus race equality is not what I am here for, I want to reiterate women in tech is great but there are there should be some similar initiative towards having people from minority backgrounds in the tech industry as well. Its only fair that there should be some representation of different people of colour in order to be calling your workplace a diverse workplace. Look being the only woman in an office surrounded by males is not ideal also being the only black female surrounded by male co-workers is not ideal well I'll let be the judge of which one you think is worse, both make you feel isolated having office that brings your culture agenda forward makes you feel comfortable

### Why are you not helping people?

For people from underrepresented ethnic groups working in tech you can't play your diversity card you've already been played it represent your minority by showing up and taking part and asking for progression.

Unspoken connections similarly going into a place where someone who looks like you there is a comfort level already established stop being so quiet make some noise get your level

if you are a white and improve allege position in your company is not enough to open the door and say well we can hire somebody that is from a ethnic minority, do more imagine somebody like me imagine us in your own shoes imagine one of us doing your job can you make that a reality.

### Try different approach.

Try a different approach or go against the grain.

Giving somebody a job because they are given to you by recruiter is just lazy do some research use another matrix or people smart, do they work hard, are they humble are they a A player. In your companies you have many people that are married do you have matrix showing how many of them have children, do you have matrix showing how own their own homes. These are stats that show how well you are treating people in your workplace these are stats that show how comfortable people are in their jobs to be making these long term commitments.

You need to change the philosophy of the company you shouldn't be focusing on only profit.

If you are CEO of a company you should be asking yourself can my staff do what I can do or can I make sure that my staff are given the same options that I am giving. A CEO should be a role model that every staff should be trying to attain.

What happens when you hire somebody that is from a minority ethnic group what happens, is it the case that black person is the only black person in that company so they have to start assimilated acting like white guy to fit in the role.

If it's a woman that you have hire does she have to become manly(one of the boys) to fit in, in the office.

What is the culture that drives your company, having a office that brings your culture and gender forward and makes you feel comfortable it's what people should be looking for that's the type of workplaces that we should be creating for others.

If interviewing is done right you will get somebody you'll get people that will help you and your business to achieve.

If you understand the opportunity then why not this person.

The potential for more but the restriction holding them back. Rather than hire someone that did it like that, try recognising talent in these places and giving them opportunities and giving them room as a company to let them achieve.

Micro goals and flexibility to adjust.

### Culture, Profit and Work

We should look at culture profit and work as the Holy Trinity these three things should not outweigh each other Profit should drive culture, Culture should drive profit and work all three should be balance when making decisions and all three should have consistency behind them.

People need to start asking the question why don't we rather than this is what we always do if you don't like how things are being done why not show people how to do the things the better way.

There are companies out there in Nottingham that make £10 million in profits a year but give four thousand pounds a year for women in tech to promote diversity in tech.

There are companies out there that turn over £10 million in profits a year and they give zero to project function to promote black and ethnic minorities in tech.

Find an office that brings your culture forward being able to go to work and being able to put your music on on Spotify and being celebrated for it that's the type of office somebody from a mix and diverse background should be trying to get into.

### Core Vision &amp; Goals

let's talk about core vision and goals having a core vision and actually attaching change to that goal of improving diversity inclusivity in your organization is the only way that you will achieve change in that organization. You could try removing the name removing the location of a job removing the date of birth from a application thinking that you were removing bias but I will guarantee you that as soon as a person into the next round of interviews where they have to do a face to face interview and that person is being interviewed by somebody that is looking for somebody that looks like them they won't get the job.

Organizations are lazy they don't want to fix it because it's just easier I have somebody that likes horse riding I like the same things that they do I look like them organization don't want to surround himself with people that don't look like them because I think they might rock the boat so they look for something where everybody is identical standing in a straight line.

Compared to actually having a set goal where that is coming from the top from the CEO saying he wants more diversity you want somebody from different backgrounds and cultures within his organization and putting that as a core vision and a goal within the company so everybody is on that point and everybody wants to do that.

These are the things that we need to do in order to become better.

Our industry is a beautiful one I work here and I would like to see my kids looking up to me and thinking they could possibly work here in the future but if there nothing more being done for somebody from diverse minority ethnic groups

To be able to come into a tech industry and feel comfortable and feel like they are included feel like they can go anywhere within the company there will always be a shortage of people that look like me in tech.

### Thank you

Thank you for watching I really appreciate the time that you've spent now hope that this talk has left you with some enlightenment and maybe push you in some direction towards wanting some change and hopefully you understand where I'm coming from as a black person within tech.

                    Introduction
                </h3>
                <p class="post-template__text">
                    So my name is Dwayne Codling I am a front-end developer at JH I've been doing frontend for the last
                    three years and before becoming a front-end I was a lecturer Nottingham College for three years so
                    you never know.
                </p>
                <p class="post-template__text">My arrival in the tech industry was not a traditional one no CS degree
                    here. I like my place within the tech industry doing front-end I love it something that I actually
                    love going to work to and love building stuff and I think if I can have some way of doing some type
                    of things where I'm helping people on a day to day basis then I'm happy so I think that role suits
                    me well.
                </p>

                <h3 class="post-template__header">Diversity Vs. Inclusion</h3>

                <p class="post-template__text">
                    So the talk is on Diversity Vs. Inclusion versus inclusion and the reason I am doing the talk is
                    because I am a Black man and maybe it would come across better if there was someone white standing
                    up here talking about Diversity but you know.</p>
                <p class="post-template__text">I think I wanted to represent what I as an individual
                    face on a day to day, not only that but what I see in the industry and what I have researched and
                    hopefully you know I can actually spread the word and give some advice to companies in order how to
                    get people from more diverse backgrounds I mean people from different, black, ethic minorities,
                    different cultures, asians, different races, creed, classes within the Industry. </p>
                <p class="post-template__text">I don’t care, we
                    just need to get more of a mix within this industry and I just feel strongly about that so this talk
                    is literal done just to make sure I am helping people. I am helping companies that have some way of
                    going towards having more of people from different races within their company and it’s not only
                    represented by one race. So this is where the talk comes in. So Let’s get straight in to it.
                </p>
                <h3 class="post-template__header">Generational Wealth Gap?</h3>
                <p class="post-template__blockquote">
                    So somewhere done the line if you had your family owned a home that was
                    worth ten thousand pounds maybe in another hundred years it might be worth 10 million pounds
                </p>
                <p class="post-template__text post-template__text--underline">
                    Now let's start from a start so the generational wealth gap so anybody know what the generational
                    wealth gap is so it's very interested because the way generational wealth happens is that your dad
                    would have inherited some an inheritance from his dad and then prior to that is that would have
                    inherited some inheritance that could be in the form of land, money, car something of value could be
                    a painting or whatever and over the years the way especially if is land.</p> <p class="post-template__text">the way land works is like
                    if you own a piece of land now and say with economy going up or whatever the land appreciates in
                    value if economies go up or it could depreciate in value if the economy contacts, the majority of
                    time it goes up in value. </p> <p class="post-template__text">So somewhere done the line if you had your family owned a home that was
                    worth ten thousand pounds maybe in another hundred years it might be worth 10 million pounds just
                    for just for the way of talking about generational wealth so but I want to take it a little bit
                    further and this is why I'm gonna take a little further so you know you understand what generation
                of what it is let's take back a bit further.</p>  <p class="post-template__text">So let's put yourself back to 1865 in America so any
                    needs expire in America something happened the slaves were free so if you were a black person that
                    was working on a plantation you were free and when you got freedom, you're a free man no but
                    obviously you want you have no power or or any kind of influence in society so the one thing that
                    the person the freed slaves in America asks for to get feel like they could they could start off at
                    the starting blocks and maybe be able to catch up with their white counterpart was to get some land
                    so they asked for land from the president of a time that was Lincoln and he said okay I promise you
                you get some land and that will help you guys to build. </p><p class="post-template__text"> in order to build in society to get back to
                    a point where black and white might become the same on equal footing it would be equality and stuff
                    like that now what happened was very tragic because President Lincoln died and that promise was
                    never fulfilled so the successive President Lincoln was Andrew Jackson and when he came into power
                    he basically revoke that promise because he had a lot of pressure from white plantation owners who
                    did not want to give any slave, ex-slave I should say land to make them feel like they were equal in
                    society.

                </p>
                <h3 class="post-template__header">
                    £792,000,000
                </h3>
                <p class="post-template__text">
                    So slavery was a very profitable economy when it comes to the economy it was very profitable so
                    anybody that was a white plantation owner became a millionaire and especially in America it sprouted
                    millionaires, most millionaires in the southern states than any other commodity of these days, if
                    you were dealing in slavery you were rich and now those southern states they actually became the
                    economic engine that actually run the United States so if you were a slave owner from the southern
                    states you had privileged to you had influence. if you just were a person that had slaves and had a
                    stake running in the plantation industry.
                </p>
                <p class="post-template__text">
                    So know everybody will be saying that was in America, we are in the UK, so what does that have to do
                    with us, we never had slaves in England and you might be right but guess what there was loads of
                    people that live in England that had slaves in the colonies and this is what happened between 1632
                    to 1807 (nearly 200 years) Britain slave merchants made a profit of 12 million pounds on the
                    purchase and sale of African people. </p>
                <p class="post-template__text">So if there were selling selling them to America they were
                    making money if they were selling them to the colonies they were making money and believe it or not
                    they were slave ports in England where people were transferred slaves to the colonies, Namely form
                    Liverpool and Bristol in England they transfer slaves to different places in the so not only America
                    but other British Colonies, that were apart of the British Empire and there are different places
                    where people in living in England own slaves in these colonies and profited from the plantation
                    system.
                </p>
                <p class="post-template__text">
                    So if you think about 12 million that's what the figure is on the board so 12 million in today's
                    money it's nearly a billion dollars, are you like amaze, so believe it or not so if your fore
                    fathers of any kind had any kind of business back in the days dealing with slavery and that money
                    that gets passed on from generation to generation to generations, just think about the start you
                    would have had what backing you have come in to life with. Contrast that to a black person that
                    forefather where slaves and stated with nothing, it’s like starting a race with Usain Bolt and being
                    shoot in the foot at the starting line you have no hope of competing.
                </p>
                <p class="post-template__text">
                    I've done it in a way where I want you to think that if you go white because you've always been in
                    power because it's always been somebody that is white in Power, it's always been somebody white
                    that's passing in the law for somebody that is white, the majority of the society predominantly as
                    you know is catering to somebody that is white.</p>  <p class="post-template__text">I mean mainstream caters to somebody that is white,
                    the tech industry now even though it's been around short period of time especially like internet
                    only been around for the last thirty years, the majority of people are at the higher level within
                    the industry are white, so if you think about that the generational wealth gap between somebody that
                    has so much behind them so much influenced so much power behind them compared to a person that’s
                    black.
                </p>
                <h3 class="post-template__header">
                    The influence of white culture on the mainstream
                </h3>
                <p class="post-template__text">
                    it's fascinating when you think about that because if you think about the influence of all of
                    somebody that is white and depiction of white culture in the mainstream compared to black culture
                    within mainstream you know that there is a distinct gap between programs on TV that caters to
                    somebody who’s from somebody that is from a minority background.
                    </p>
                <p class="post-template__text">
                    Plus there is so much institutional
                    prejudice that has arise because of that and because bills were made into laws and you know all of
                    these different parliaments that go through and the majority of people cater for people that look
                    like them and it's just the case where we've come to this and somebody from black or minority ethnic
                    group is still fighting have some type of equality and even within the technique industry, we are
                    still fighting to have that type of equality which if you think about it it's crazy I mean it's 2020
                    are we still talking about this but yeah we're still talking about this because we still need to
                    talk about this so let's talk about.

                    Nottingham Tech Scene
                </h3>
                <p class="post-template__text">
                    So the Nottingham tech, the tech industry Nottingham would you consider it to be diverse? A lot of
                    people would say yes because we have a lot of of meet-ups that you know cater for people from
                    different areas of tech, and we have women in tech and we have loads of different projects that are
                    ongoing, we have project functions which talk about helping somebody from underprivileged
                    backgrounds towards coming into tech, so we have lots of initiatives in place where we're trying to
                    get people from that type of cultures into the tech industry so Nottingham looks like we okay, you
                    think so let's see.
                </p>
                <p class="post-template__text">
                    So the tech industry in Nottingham when somebody says diverse and I and I will say this most people
                    when they talk about the tech industry being diverse, it’s all about I've hired a white woman to fit
                    this role and because we've hired two white women and we have 10 other white male that work in the
                    office we have a diverse business.
                </p>
                <p class="post-template__text">
                    We're diverse that's what people say when they're in Nottingham
                    and I've seen it myself I've commented on it you can see go check my Twitter feed it is a case where
                    people of this mindset when they talk about diversity, is that you have you have white females
                    working in the tech industry but it's not a black female or Asian female or a Chinese female are
                    somebody from a different minority ethnic group is somebody that is white and for me as a black
                    person looking in.</p>
                <p class="post-template__text">I'm looking for somebody that looks as a representation of me I cannot
                    see that,
                    I don't see that that white female as diverse that she might be for somebody that is white she's not
                    diverse enough for somebody that is black and all powers to somebody that is hiring a female, I’m
                    all for it but I'm just thinking that we could do better, we can do some more when it comes to other
                    people from diverse ethnicity as well.
                </p>
                <p class="post-template__text">
                    Because the reality is that, that’s what people call diverse when I don't think they should
                    Because for me you know women in tech I'm gonna say this it's mostly white women in tech and it's
                    really bad to say that what is the truth it's like if you think about it it's like the most people
                    that get hired and when you are getting hired look like everybody else I've been working in that
                    company and the majority of people that are working in the tech industry now even in Nottingham that
                    has a multitude of mixed and diverse ethnic groups as is a mixed diverse city, the multitude of
                    people that get hired into the industrial are white, now how can we say we are making products and
                    services and representing society within tech if that is the case.

                <p class="post-template__text">
                    Now this is what I am talking about look at the tech community versus our society, look at the
                    majority of kids born now or mixed race, my kids are mixed race, the majority of families that you
                    see are all mixed you have so many different cultures within the city but compare that to the tech
                    industry within Nottingham.
                </p>
                <p class="post-template__text">
                    I won't show it but you can look look at the different companies and look at the people that work at
                    these companies look up their Instagram photos for their for their Christmas party look look up
                    their Instagram post for their for their team meetings where they are showing all of these zoom call
                    photos of the entire company, predominantly white and that's just what it is that's just what it is
                    now if we thinking about building a tech community that truly represents our society if we're
                    thinking about building a tech industry that represents our society that is contrary that is
                    complete opposite to what the society is diversity for me means having different opinions from
                    different people of all shades colour and abilities that's what diversity means.

                <h3 class="post-template__header">Ignorance is a real thing!</h3>
                <p class="post-template__text">
                    Some people say you know you just ignorant and it's the case where you know empathy you can
                    empathise with somebody else and you can you can get similar feelings, you can understand where
                    somebody's coming from and I understand lot of people say no I don't see colour you know somebody
                    white, somebody black it means nothing to me it's all the same it's all about the person and the
                    individual it's not about the colour of their skin and I get that I get that.
                </p>
                <p class="post-template__text">
                    Oh yeah but in the rest assure ignorance is a real thing, I mean there's a certain level of
                    knowledge you can never attain.
                </p>
                <p class="post-template__text">
                    Example, look I was born black and I will never have knowledge of what it is like to be white
                    ,never, the opposite is also true though you know if you are a born white you will never fully
                    understand what it is to be black.
                </p>
                <p class="post-template__text">
                    But how does one gained some understanding from somebody else, it's about having conversations it's
                    about asking, it's about researching, it's about learning. You might never be empathetic towards
                    somebody if you don't have an vested interest in that person to begin with
                </p>
                <p class="post-template__text">
                    In order for you to have a vested interest you have to have these conversations, we have to talk for
                    you to know, how I feel as a black man working in the tech industry, plus you have to talk to other
                    people from other cultures for them to know where you are coming from, so in order to do this thing
                    where we are going to try to make this a better industry we first have to start from the ground up.

                <h3 class="post-template__header"> Look at things through different lenses.</h3>
                <p class="post-template__text">
                    So firstly we need to be looking at things with different lenses we need to invite diversity and
                    inclusivity into our workplace and we need to be promoting diversity in these ways in the tech
                    industry. We need diversity and we need inclusivity. The tech industry need people to help them look
                    through different lenses in oder to change the response to different problems we face, we have loads
                    of problems that we go through on a day to day and it's important that we are different people from
                    different backgrounds, culture, ethnic groups involve in order to help to fix these issues.
                </p>
                <p class="post-template__text">
                    The tech industry is booming at the minute I mean look at it zoom is booming, ecommerce is booming,
                    we in a lock down and yet I'm here being able to do this talk where I'm trying to give you a point
                    of view because I'm working in the tech industry. But if we don't have buy-in if we don't have the
                    bye in of everybody in the society, when feelings change and things move on and there's no longer an
                    appetite for it our industry will fail.
                </p>
                <p class="post-template__text">
                    The only way to guarantee that our industry doesn't fail is that we need to have everybody and I
                    mean everyone we need to have people from different cultures, different ethnic group in the industry
                    solving the problems that industry face in order to make it better and we need to be building a
                    community that truly represents our society because these are the people that we are actually
                    selling these product to, these are the people that we're making product and services for so we
                    should in theory have that representation within our workplaces.
                </p>
                <h3 class="post-template__header"> How can we do better? </h3>
                <p class="post-template__text">
                    You might ask yourself how can we do better, there was a saying folks you to say to me growing up
                    and I
                    firmly believe in it “it takes a community to raise a child” and what that means is that we need to
                    give
                    a bit of our time and to invest in the industry.
                </p>
                <p class="post-template__text">
                    What we need to be thinking about is saying to yourself “we need to be planting these seeds yeah
                    that we
                    will never, I mean that we will never see become trees.
                </p>
                <p class="post-template__text">
                    What I mean by this is that we need to be doing things that we don't need to be seen the benefits
                    from
                    straight away but long-term we know it has the potential to bloom into something great and I will
                    stomp
                    it on for you.

                <p class="post-template__text">This is Mel and her daughter so Mell was introduced to me about a year
                    ago about no year
                    and a half ago and what what I what she wanted was to get into the industry long story she was a
                    college
                    student she this is her second skint at college. </p>
                <p class="post-template__text">
                    The first time she left was because she felt pregnant she got married and you know a lot of things
                    happen but kind of what kind of what kind of drive her was the fact that she felt like she was in a
                    situation where not a lot of people thought that she would have been able to become somebody.
                </p>
                <p class="post-template__text">
                    She felt like the tech industry, web development is what she specialized in, was something she could
                    actually do, she had a quick brain she felt like she could learn a lot, she’s was a bit rough around
                    the
                    edges but she felt like if she put the time in because she was read about a lot of people that has
                    self-learn she could get there and all she needed was a mentor to push her along and that's what she
                    asked me to do.
                </p>
                <p class="post-template__text">
                    Now the only thing I had to do was to give her one hour of my time on a week-to-week basis one of my
                    Lodge and I met up with her and I basically spoke to her about what she was working on look at her
                    work
                    gave her critique and told her how to do better and then she came back showed me how she did it
                    better
                    and it was ongoing until a point where she finished uni she applied for a job she got a job in the
                    industry at Adtrack.
                </p>
                <p class="post-template__text">
                    This is Mel now, Mel has literally gone skyrocketed to the point now where she is in the industry
                    mentoring others telling them all how to get into the industry it was something that she dreamt of
                    and
                    because she felt like she could with a helping hand, she has achieved it.
                </p>
                <p class="post-template__text">
                    She's at the point where she wants to do the same for other people she's working in the industry and
                    her
                    daughter looks up to her and copies her mom in everything she does and there's a potential there for
                    a
                    daughter to become somebody in this industry because she sees her mom as a role model as somebody
                    that
                    looks like her that is not just a white woman working in the tech industry but somebody from a
                    minority
                    ethic background that possibly her daughter could actually come and do the same thing her mom does.

                <p class="post-template__text">
                    And this is what I mean by planting seeds that you will never see become tress the potential for
                    daughter to become something because of her mom doing this is great and that's what I think we need
                    to
                    do more of.

                    you are asked employ somebody
                    there are two candidates, one candidate white you have met before you're aware of that person work

                    you
                    make products for, then your team meetings your Christmas party, would look like what society looks
                    like
                    but it doesn't I've looked at them I've seen your Instagram posts I've seen all of those Christmas
                    parties I've seen your all company calls and the majority of people working in the tech industry are
                    white, there’s a distinct shape of black and colour missing from these pictures that represent the
                    industry.

                    embrace diversity and inclusion approach it as a team sport talent acquisition should act like the
                    backup point guard in basketball or attacking midfielder in football setting up and feeding
                    teammates so

                    about this and she posted video of a little black girl black was hugging this female developer
                    because
                    she was saying I cannot believe that you're the head of this massive company and you look just like
                    me,
                    that sent shockwaves through my body because it is so important for somebody that look like me to be
                    out
                    here giving a talk because what it does is that somebody coming up can see this and can feel like

                    marginalised. There is a severe lack of accessibility for blacks and minority ethnic groups in the

                    working in the industry why should it be somebody else lack of representation affects you personally
                    when you never understand what it means to be black guess the same way I will never understand what

                    when you are accustom to something all your life do you see it as a privilege there is more than one

                    I grow in Jamaica there were different shades of black in Jamaica the majority of the population
                    would be considered to be black but if your skin tone was lighter you were given preferential
                    treatment and was seen as above others. When I was growing up the Prime Minister look like a white
                    man but he govern a country that was distinctly black, I never grew up thinking I could become the
                    Prime Minister because that's what I saw and that was in Jamaica, but somebody is saying to me that
                    in England were the predominantly population his white I do not see colour everybody is the same I

                    others we know white is the default mode but dark mode is sweet it saves batteries , it’s easier on
                    the eyes at night having an option to switch it's not a bad thing, being different is not a bad
                    thing, it leads to discovering approaches and thinking outside the box from the default choice to
                    solve problems.

                <p class="post-template__text">
                    Sacrificing something for a greater good is not a bad thing it leads to enlightenment, teach
                    yourself above everyone else that is not white there's a tonne of literature you can stop don't see
                    colours or they are no prejudices or there's no racism that’s just being ignorant and is because you
                    don’t have a more diverse view of the world.

                    if you continue to look at the headlines or you continue to look at your social media feed or your
                    YouTube algorithm, this is not reality, in reality the world is made up of different races and
                    different individuals with different beliefs we all breathe the same air and use the resources the
                    earth provides in order to live.
                    it would be ideal for you to have some more conversation with somebody that is not just from your
                    clique of people that you go out with on a day-to-day and not the same skin colour that you are and
                    understand their culture and their backgrounds and beliefs.

                    Stories and drive should be used evaluate how it fits your company agenda. Gender equality versus
                    race equality is not what I am here for, I want to reiterate women in tech is great but there are
                    there should be some similar initiative towards having people from minority backgrounds in the tech
                    industry as well. Its only fair that there should be some representation of different people of
                    colour in order to be calling your workplace a diverse workplace. Look being the only woman in an
                    office surrounded by males is not ideal also being the only black female surrounded by male
                    co-workers is not ideal well I'll let be the judge of which one you think is worse, both make you
                    feel isolated having office that brings your culture agenda forward makes you feel comfortable

                    For people from underrepresented ethnic groups working in tech you can't play your diversity card
                    you've already been played it represent your minority by showing up and taking part and asking for
                    progression.

                    if you are a white and improve allege position in your company is not enough to open the door and
                    say well we can hire somebody that is from a ethnic minority, do more imagine somebody like me
                    imagine us in your own shoes imagine one of us doing your job can you make that a reality.

                    Giving somebody a job because they are given to you by recruiter is just lazy do some research use

                    companies you have many people that are married do you have matrix showing how many of them have
                    children, do you have matrix showing how own their own homes. These are stats that show how well you
                    are treating people in your workplace these are stats that show how comfortable people are in their
                    jobs to be making these long term commitments.

                    What happens when you hire somebody that is from a minority ethnic group what happens, is it the

                    acting like white guy to fit in the role.

                    let's talk about core vision and goals having a core vision and actually attaching change to that
                    goal of improving diversity inclusivity in your organization is the only way that you will achieve
                    change in that organization. You could try removing the name removing the location of a job removing
                    the date of birth from a application thinking that you were removing bias but I will guarantee you
                    that as soon as a person into the next round of interviews where they have to do a face to face
                    interview and that person is being interviewed by somebody that is looking for somebody that looks
                    like them they won't get the job.

                    surround himself with people that don't look like them because I think they might rock the boat so

                    organization and putting that as a core vision and a goal within the company so everybody is on that

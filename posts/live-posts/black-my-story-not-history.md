alt:  Black History Month Celebration
title: How the JH team celebrated <strong>Black History Month</strong>
date: 28th October 2020
excerpt: "I wanted to write a little about this month, in particular, <strong>October</strong> the month in the UK where we celebrate Black History."
---
Let’s mention first, that I am personally looking to change the current levels of underrepresented black professionals in the tech industry, particularly in a Leadership position.

You cannot be what you cannot see, and I want to be a role model, especially to my two little black boys who look up to me.

All that being said, I wanted to write about the last month in particular, October, the month in the UK where we celebrate Black History.

Some home truths; I have never celebrated black history month in the UK, even though it started way back in 1989, and I have been in the UK since 2002. I cannot remember a time when it was a thing I celebrated. It’s not like Halloween that’s openly celebrated by all, it seems Black History Month has always been an under the radar thing. I wanted this month to be different.

Recent events have highlighted the fight for racial equality, and the resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement. What better time to bring BHM into the mainstream and celebrate the lives of Black People than right now?

This year, being in lockdown, it was important I celebrated Black History Month not just with friends and family, but with the team at JH too. So for 31 days straight, I have been sharing black people who inspire me with my work colleagues on the company’s Slack channel and sharing these inspirational black individuals’ history, stories, books, movies and videos.

It seemed like an easy enough task as I somewhat have a trump card of being a black person who loves history. At first, it was easy, as I knew about most of the Black Americans historical figures that we see posted about every year. But then I felt I could go deeper, so I focused on finding other inspirational black people whose stories are not in the mainstream, focusing on the UK, Africa, Caribbean and US from different eras past and present.

I learnt a lot more and shared these incredible stories, but there was a point where I felt somewhat self-conscious about bombarding my work colleagues on Slack every day at 7:30am with a post about black individuals lives, stories and histories. Most of my colleagues are white, and some of these figures and events are brand new to them.

It was on day 19 where I felt like something needed to change. Me being that one black guy singing the praise hymn out aloud in church annoying the heck out of everyone else. I don’t like that guy, just saying!

**So I just ask everyone a simple question,**

_“Today marks day 19 of Black History Month, though I think I have been celebrating this with everyone, I do feel like I am the only guy at the party so here’s the challenge from tomorrow until the end of Black History Month. I would appreciate it if you could find time to join in by highlighting someone black that has inspired you. That is all.”_

It’s crazy how things work when you show vulnerability. The responses I got led me to have one of the best feelings I have ever had working at any company.

I felt like I was celebrating with everyone else that posted and took the time to talk about what black person inspired them and why they inspired them. It was all digital, but the feelings that came over me could not have been more real.

It caused a pivotal shift in my mindset. It was not about me as the only black person pushing the message, but everyone that I worked with who took part also had black people they wanted to celebrate and looked upon as inspirational.

I was in awe of some of the stories and people that got posted, and I learnt so much more by having more people involved. I don’t think words can truly express how it made me feel; it made me appreciate my colleagues more and saw them as like-minded individuals.

That gave me the boost to carry on researching and posting and sharing, and not only did it inspire me to continue, but it also made me think how truly lucky I am to work where I work.

The people I work with care about what black people of colour have gone through. As a black person, because I know they see other black people as inspirational, I am content to relax more at work, rather than constantly being mindful of how others see me and feeling the need to overcompensate. I can just continue to be me, I need not fit in a mould or be another clone, they can appreciate what they see, what I am, which is also a black person.

Here is my list of inspiring black people and stories, along with the ones contributed by my colleagues at JH. Hope you find this as educational as I have, on so many levels:

Du Bois also wrote incisively on the black condition, including the observation that blacks have a double consciousness. “It is a peculiar sensation, this double-consciousness, this sense of always looking at one’s self through the eyes of others, of measuring one’s soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity. One ever feels his two-ness, — an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.”

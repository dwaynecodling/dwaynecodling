                    <h3 id="frontend" class="about-me__heading">How did you get into being a Front-end Developer?</h3>

                    <p  class="about-me__text">
                        It was when at University, doing a Multimedia course that I gravitated toward web design and
                        development. There I learnt a little about Front-end, and over the years I’ve done several
                        Front-end projects that I’ve always enjoyed.
                    </p>

                    <p class="about-me__text"> While being a Lecturer of Media at New College Nottingham I delivered on
                        several web modules to
                        students. I practised by doing freelance jobs using modern best practice, all so that I was
                        confident in teaching the students real-time knowledge that’d set them up best for getting jobs
                        out there.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="about-me__heading"> What made you make the switch from college to agency life? </h3>

                    <p class="about-me__text"> Lecturing was great for me, it gave me time to develop my skills, I made
                        some lifelong friends,
                        and was able to start a small web design development practice with a couple of my
                        colleagues.
                    </p>

                    <p class="about-me__text"> But, I felt it was the right time to make a change: My personal life had
                        taken some fairly
                        exciting turns – in that time I’d become engaged, and my partner and I had our second child. In
                        honesty, I wanted to be more, and do more, for my family.
                    </p>

                    <p class="about-me__text"> Lecturing felt like a hard slog sometimes. Being able to inspire young
                        people was amazing,
                        something I’ll always feel passionate about. But obviously, that’s sometimes hard to do as a
                        lecturer. When we had designers from JH in to speak– the students were so inspired, without
                        exaggerating, for some of them it was pretty life-changing.
                    </p>

                    <p class="about-me__text"> Now I’m working here I feel I’ll be able to do more for the young people
                        wanting to enter this
                        industry. It gives me a unique perspective on seeing it from both sides: both lecturing and
                        working in an agency. I would really like to help to bridge the gap of what is expected from
                        students leaving education wanting to enter into a role like this. I’d really like to help JH
                        extend further into helping students get into the industry – there's definitely plenty of
                        opportunities to do so here.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="about-me__heading">
                        What drew you to JH as a place to work?
                    </h3>

                    <p class="about-me__text"> JH is quite different from other agencies. Its commitment to the
                        community, seen by DXN, the event it runs, the support it gives to universities and colleges,
                        and a whole lot more – for me, that really sets it apart. Like so many in Nottingham, I’ve
                        always seen it as being somewhere I’d love to work sometime.
                    </p>

                    <p class="about-me__text"> I’d been thinking about moving into full-time web development recently
                        after learning so much: I
                        knew I was now skilled enough and felt confident in my ability to learn more, so there was
                        nothing stopping me going for it.
                    </p>

                    <p class="about-me__text"> I just needed to find a company that was aligned to my career
                        progression, attitude towards
                        education – with creative, fun, and highly skilled people to be around, luckily JH was hiring.

                    </p>
                    <h3 class="about-me__heading">How are you finding it here so far?</h3>

                    <p class="about-me__text"> I feel very welcome and everyone has really gone above and beyond to make
                        sure that I’m comfortable. Being the new kid in the office is strange, as I feel like I’m an old
                        face here, having met so many of the team, and have worked with a fair few too – I’ve hot-desked
                        here for my own work plenty of times too.
                    </p>

                    <p class="about-me__text"> Now my hunger to learn more is what's driving me, I realise that there
                        are so many more levels
                        to where I want to go, and in order to get there I need to learn from the best: Some of the best
                        people in the industry work here.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="about-me__heading"> Have you got any advice for anyone looking for a career in Design /
                        Development?
                    </h3>

                    <p class="about-me__text"> Personally, I think attending the brilliant meet-ups we have in
                        Nottingham for the community is
                        a really great start. JH’s DXN on the second Wednesday of every month, in Nottingham’s Creative
                        Quarter, and it’s a brilliant way to find out more and meet people in the industry.
                    </p>

                    <p class="about-me__text"> In fact, it was December 2016 at DXN that change my mindset completely,
                        it was a talk from designer
                        Gareth Strange, it was called “change is good”. That hit a chord, and I felt like he was talking
                        directly to me. After that, I decided to give it my all, applying for a Front-end Developer job
                        they were advertising for at the time.
                    </p>

                    <p class="about-me__text"> Just remember life is short, if you want to be in the industry, be in the
                        industry – go to the
                        events, put in the groundwork, so that you’re ready when the opportunity comes.
                    </p>

                    <p class="about-me__text"> The effects of no mentorship
                        Time wasted
                        Made my first website in 1999

                        Low confidence
                        Not knowing what’s possible
                        Told not to pursue web
                        Harry's Journey

                        A Mentorship at an earlier stage could have changed that
                        I had to observe life at agency during a placement at University and a previous job  to realise what the possibilities are.People just don’t know

                        “There are many paths, but one journey”

                        Naomi Judd


                        Never too late
                        Everybody is on a path, any small bit of help can help their overall journey.

                        Dwayne next on ‘going around changing lives”.

                        2. Going out and changing lives.
                        Your time is very valuable and giving a little bit can help anybody on the outside a huge amount (to get in) -  (10 mins)

                        Mentoring
                        Helping those on the outside with coaching, mentorship and advice (Dwayne) - with examples (5 mins)

                        Dwayne: Passing it over to Harry any you will showcase what people within work can do.


                        Code Club
                        Helping those on the inside with giving your time
                        Initially was meant to be peer coding and joint learningEnded up being a mentorship from 2-3 other devs

                        Peer coding, sharing your knowledge
                        This goes for people at ANY stage of their learning. Coding/sharing knowledge can help snowball all kinds of big ideas.Giving back is super important and sharing what you’ve learnt which is what these people do.Next, Dwayne on how he gave back.

                        3. How to give back
                        Different ways of giving back and helping someone else grow

                        Talking at College /University

                        Slack Group
                        Everyone sharing knowledge

                        Coaching
                        Taking a back seat while letting other learn from doing it themselves



                        In life, the real jackpot is people, not money


                        Blogging/Articles

                        YouTube
                        Open Source Contributions

                        Being part of the local community (meetups, doing talks, networking).
                        Just get your knowledge out there

                        “A mentor is someone who allows you to see the hope inside yourself”

                        Oprah Winfrey


                        Hope is very important and a lot of people can’t see from the outside what’s possible.Be the person who inspires and gives hope to those without, you can make a real difference in people’s lives with the smallest of efforts.Thanks for listening guys, that’s been Mentorship by me and Dwayne.

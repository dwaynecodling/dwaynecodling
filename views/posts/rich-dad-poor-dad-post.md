## Notes ##
---
- Rich people make money work for them. 
- Poor people work for money. 
Richest is not measured by how much money you earn but what you do with the money you earn.
Use your head to work out financial planning rather that just complain that you don't earn enough.
- Acquiring assets is the best way to get rich.  
- Having a solid financial foundation that means putting in the time to build up your finances is key.
- Always think about long term goals rather than short term. It's better to live in a small house for 5 years and own it outright selling it and buying a bigger on in the short term. You could make more money for the future and using the small house as an asset to invest in other to acquire a bigger house for less cost.
- Being broke is temporary, being poor is eternal, better to have less money while building a solid foundation for the future.
- Partnership can be a great way of helping to manage risk.
- Manage fear and greed in order to reap benefits.
- Making income generating assets, investing in start-ups and small businesses, investment consortiums. Rental and real estate investment , investing in student ideas.

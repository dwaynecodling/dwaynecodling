## Notes ##
----
Did image load Via Magento Header and footer on to Crafters Companion WordPress site

The issue was the JS template not showing up the was due to me not having the two environment running locally and was using staging to test the work was successful.

To add a template to the WP container you need to add the block that adds the PHTML code.  The file is key to getting the JS running on the WordPress site. 

Learnt that sometimes you can face an uphill battle if you don’t have all the tools. And even though it’s humbling asking for help when you are trying to resolve an issue yourself it might be necessary to.  It However still leaves me feeling a bit annoyed, having to bother someone to help me out for something that I should be able to do myself. But got to look at fit from another angle , it’s not about me its about the Customer and the User that is waiting to have the issue resolve.

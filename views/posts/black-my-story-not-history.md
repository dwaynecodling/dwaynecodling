alt:  Black History Month Celebration
title: Black <strong>My Story</strong> (Not History)
date: 28th October 2020
excerpt: "I wanted to write a little about this month, in particular, <strong>October</strong> the month in the UK where we celebrate Black History."
---
So let’s talk, I haven’t done a post in a while. So the world changed a bit but rather than focusing on the negative let’s be positive, things have been going well at work, and I am now a Pod Lead. The reason I wanted to be a Pod Lead is that I wanted to put my colleagues and company in the best position that would make them successful. 

Personally, also I wanted to change the current levels of underrepresented black professionals in the tech industry, particularly in a Leadership position.

You cannot be what you cannot see, and I want to be a role model, especially to my two little black boys who look up to me.

All that being said I wanted to write a little about this month, in particular, October, the month in the UK where we celebrate Black History.

Some home truths, I have never celebrated black history month in the UK even though this month started way back in 1989, and I have been in the UK since 2002. I cannot remember a time when it was a thing I celebrated, it’s not like Halloween that we have adopted as a celebration event it seems to always been low key, under the radar thing, but with recent events highlighting the fight for racial equality, and the resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement it seems to have had some traction this year and I have seen more mention of it in the mainstream.

Do I feel bad I never took time to reflect and celebrate in previous years, short answer Yes I do, but probably not for the reasons you think.

So this year to celebrate I started with a simple idea, being in lockdown and wanting to do something to not just focus on work and family at home. I could stick to a new routine for 31 days that could help put more interesting learning within every quickly passing day.

I seem to work particularly well when I have a set goal to achieve with a time limit, ala P90x, Insanity, frankly any Beachbody fitness program and Veganuary to name a few. I am just particularly wired to stick to set programs until completion.

So for 28 days straight I have been sharing Black people who inspire me with my work colleagues on the company’s slack channel and sharing these inspirational black individuals’ history, stories, books, movies and videos. It seems like an easy enough task as I somewhat have a trump card of being a black person who loves history. It would have been a straightforward task to complete.

At first, it was easy as I knew about most of the Black Americans historical figures that we see posted about every year but then I felt I could go deeper, so I focused on finding other inspirational black people whose stories are not in the mainstream. Focusing on the UK, Africa, Caribbean and US from different eras past and present.

I learnt a lot more and shared these incredible stories but there was a point where I felt somewhat self-conscious about bombarding my work colleagues on slack every day at 7:30 am with a post about black individuals lives, stories and histories, I mean most of my colleagues are white and some of these figures and events are brand new to them, it could be too much to get through and keep up with.

This feeling changed however for the better, It was on day 19 where I felt like maybe this was too much plus I felt like I was the only one doing this. Me being that one black guy singing the praise hymn out aloud in church annoying the heck out of everyone else. I don’t like that guy, just saying.

So I just ask everyone a simple question,
@here today marks day 19 of Black History Month, though I think I have been celebrating this with everyone, I do feel like I am the only guy at the party so here’s the challenge from tomorrow until the end of Black History Month. I would appreciate it if you could find time to join in by highlighting someone black that has inspired you. That is all."

It’s crazy how things work when you show vulnerability. The responses I got led me to have one of the best feelings by far I have ever had working at any company. I felt like I was celebrating with everyone else that posted and took the time to talk about what black person inspired them and why they inspired them. It was all digital, but the feelings that came over me could not have been more real.

It caused a pivotal shift in my mindset. It was not about me as the only black person pushing the message but everyone that I worked with that took part also had those black people they also wanted to celebrate with that they held in high regards and looked upon as inspirational. I was in awe of some people that got posted and learnt so much more by having more people involved. I don’t think words can truly express how it made me feel; it made me appreciate my colleagues more and saw them as like-minded individuals.

That gave me the boost to carry on researching and posting and sharing, and not only did it inspire me to continue, but it also made me think how truly lucky I am to work where I work.

The people I work with care about what black people of colour have gone through and as a black person because I know they see other black people as inspirational. I am content to relax more at work, not constantly being mindful of how others see me, and I need not overcompensate. I can just continue to be me, I need not fit in a mould or be another clone, they can appreciate what they see, what I am, which is also a black person.

Here is my list so far also the ones added in by my colleagues at JH. Hope you find this as educational as I have on so many levels.

## William Edward Burghardt Du Bois
(February 23, 1868--August 27, 1963) was an American sociologist, socialist, historian, civil rights activist, Pan-Africanist, author, writer and editor.\
Du Bois also wrote incisively on the black condition, including the observation that blacks have a double consciousness. "It is a peculiar sensation, this double-consciousness, this sense of always looking at one's self through the eyes of others, of measuring one's soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity. One ever feels his two-ness, --- an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder."\

## The Windrush Generation
After World War II, many African-Caribbean people migrated to North America and Europe, especially to the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, and the Netherlands. Because of the losses during the war, the British government encouraged mass immigration from the countries of the British Empire and Commonwealth to fill shortages in the labour market. The British Nationality Act 1948 gave Citizenship of the UK and Colonies to all people living in the United Kingdom and its colonies, and the right of entry and settlement in the UK. Better prospects attracted many West Indians in what we often referred to as the mother country.\

About him...\
A Ghanaian-British architect. He has designed buildings around the world, earning international recognition, with his most notable project being the multi-tiered National Museum of African American Arts and Culture in Washington, DC. This year he was awarded the prestigious RIBA royal gold medal which recognises considerable contributions to international architecture. He is the first black recipient in the 173-year history of the award.\
Why I picked him...\
I often look for inspiration in different places. Architecture and built environment have always fascinated me, and in another life I'd be an architect. What I love about David's work is the striking combination of patterns and materials that make his buildings become almost sculptural in appearance. That's probably why he's been invited to design a number of memorials during his career.\

## Faith Ringgold
I have quite a few artists and painters I'd love to share whose work and lives have in one way or another inspired me or taught me something. I'll start with Faith Ringgold and her beautiful, vibrant and provocative art across media -- notably, quilt, which she could easily roll up and take wherever she needed without having to rely on her husband to carry her work to a gallery (which for a fervent feminist was completely unacceptable)!\
Faith Ringgold\
As an artist, activist and children's author Ringgold (b. 1930, Harlem, New York) has challenged perceptions of African American identity and gender inequality for over five decades. Growing up in the creative and intellectual context of the Harlem Renaissance and inspired by her contemporaries including writers James Baldwin and Amiri Baraka, she is widely recognised for her painted story quilts combining personal narratives, history and politics "to tell my story, or, more to the point, my side of the story", as an African American woman.\
While working as an art teacher in public schools, Faith Ringgold began American People (1963 - 67), a series that exposes social inequalities and racial tensions she witnessed during the Civil Rights era, and culminates in her response to the Black Power movement. In the 1970s, her work and politics embraced feminism as she led protests outside New York museums demanding equal gender and racial representation in exhibitions, designed political posters and co-organised the People's Flag Show, for which she was arrested.\
"It's the 1960s, all hell is breaking loose all over, and you're painting flowers and leaves. You can't do that. Your job is to tell your story. Your story has to come out of your life, your environment, who you are, where you come from."\

## Betye Saar - Shared by my colleague
Betye Irene Saar (born July 30, 1926) is an African-American artist known for her work in the medium of assemblage. Saar has been called "a legend" in the world of contemporary art. She is a visual storyteller and an accomplished printmaker.\
Saar's work explores both the realities of African-American oppression, and the mysticism of symbols through the combination of every day found objects. "I'm the kind of person who recycles materials but I also recycle emotions and feelings," she explains. "And I had a great deal of anger about the segregation and the racism in this country."\
She was a part of the Black Arts Movement in the 1970s, and her work tackles racism through the appropriation and recontextualization of African-American folklore and icons, as seen in the seminal The Liberation of Aunt Jemima (1972), a wooden box containing a doll of a stereotypical "mammy" figure.

## Viola Davis - Shared by my colleague
To continue this wonderful thread, I'd like to highlight one of my all time favourite filmstars -- Viola Davis.\
An incredible person who started from a troubled upbringing to becoming an award winning actor.

\
She's the first black actor to win an Emmy, Tony and Oscar for acting roles:

\
What I find the most brilliant about her, is how vocal she is about the inequality in opportunity and recognition that black actors still get to this day. She's not afraid to challenge Hollywood's standards. Every time she has accepted an award, she uses that platform to speak out about the lack of opportunity for black actors in film and tv. This video is clipped from a longer interview, but she addresses these issues in terms of her personal experience in the industry, and always being compared to Meryl Streep.\

See her in: How to get away with Murder, The Help, Fences, Widows, Doubt, Suicide Squad, and she will be in an upcoming film about Harriet Tubman where she will be playing the titular role.

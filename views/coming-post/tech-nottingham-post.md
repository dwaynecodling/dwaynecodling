### Introduction

My name is Dwayne Codling. I am a front-end developer at [JH.](https://www.wearejh.com "JH.") I’ve been doing frontend for the last three years and before becoming a front-end I was a lecturer at Nottingham College for three years so you never know.

My arrival in the tech industry was not a traditional one; no CS degree here. I like my place within the tech industry doing front-end, I love it, something that I actually love going to work to and love building stuff and I think if I can have some way of doing some type of things where I’m helping people on a day to day basis then I’m happy so I think that role suits me well.


### Diversity Vs. Inclusion

The talk is on Diversity versus Inclusion and the reason I am doing the talk is because I am a Black man and maybe it would come across better if there was someone white standing up here talking about Diversity, but you know.

I think I wanted to represent what I as an individual face on a day to day, not only that but what I see in the industry and what I have researched and hopefully you know I can actually spread the word and give some advice to companies in order how to get people from more diverse backgrounds I mean people from different, black, ethic minorities, different cultures, asians, different races, creed, classes within the Industry.

I don’t care, we just need to get more of a mix within this industry and I just feel strongly about that so this talk is literally done just to make sure I am helping people. I am helping companies that have some way of going towards having more people from different races within their company and it’s not only represented by one race. So, this is where the talk comes in.

Let’s get straight into it.

### Generational Wealth Gap?

Somewhere down the line, if you had your family owning a home that was worth ten thousand pounds, maybe in another hundred years, it might be worth 10 million pounds.

Let’s start from the start: the **generational wealth gap**. So, everybody knows what generational wealth gap is, it’s very interesting because the way generational wealth happens is that your dad would have inherited some inheritance from his dad and then prior to that his dad would have inherited some inheritance that could be in the form of land, money, car, anything of value that could be a painting or whatever, and especially if it was land.

The way land works is, say you own a piece of land, now with the economy going up, the land appreciates in value if the economies go up or it could depreciate in value if the economy contracts. The majority of time it goes up in value.

Somewhere down the line if you had your family owning a home that was worth ten thousand pounds maybe in another hundred years it might be worth 10 million pounds just for just for the way of talking about generational wealth so but I want to take it a little bit further and this is why I’m gonna take a little further so you know you understand what generation of what it is let’s take back a bit further.

Put yourself back to 1865 in America. Something happened in America in 1865: the slaves were freed. If you were a black person that was working on a plantation, you were free. When you got your freedom, you’re a free man, no doubt, but obviously, you have no power or any kind of influence in society. The one thing that the person the freed slaves in America asks for, to get feel like they could they could start off at the starting blocks and maybe be able to catch up with their white counterpart, was to get some land. Thus, they asked for land from the president of the time who was Lincoln and he said: okay, I promise you you’ll get some land and that will help you to build.

In order to build in society to get back to a point where black and white might become the same on equal footing, so it would all be equal. Yet, what actually happened was very tragic. President Lincoln died and that promise was never fulfilled. The successive President, Andrew Jackson, when he came into power he basically revoked that promise because he had a lot of pressure from white plantation owners who did not want to give any slave (ex-slave, I should say) land to make them feel like they were equal in society.

### £792,000,000

Slavery was a very profitable economy. Anybody that was a white plantation owner became a millionaire and especially in America, it sprouted millionaires, most millionaires in the southern states than any other commodity of these days. If you were dealing in slavery you were rich and now those southern states they actually became the economic engine that actually ran the United States. If you were a slave owner from the southern states, you had privilege and influence. If you only were a person that had slaves, you automatically had a stake in the plantation industry.

Of course, everybody will be saying, that was in America, we are in the UK, so what does that have to do with us?! We never had slaves in England. You might be right but guess what? There were loads of people that lived in England that had slaves in the colonies and this is what happened between 1632 to 1807 (nearly 200 years!). Britain slave merchants made a profit of **12 million pounds** on the purchase and sale of African people.

If they were selling them to America, they were making money; if they were selling them to the colonies, they were making money; and believe it or not there were slave ports in England where people transferred slaves to the colonies, namely from Liverpool and Bristol in England. They transferred slaves to different places, so *not* only America but other British Colonies that were a part of the **British Empire**. 

People living in England owned slaves in the colonies and profited from the plantation system.

If you think about 12 million (that’s what the figure is on the record), 12 million in today’s money, is nearly a **billion dollars**. Believe it or not, if your fore fathers of any kind had any kind of business back in the days dealing with slavery, and that money got passed on from generation to generation to generation, just think about the start you would have had! What a backing you have come into life, with. Contrast that to a black person, whose forefathers were slaves and started with nothing; it’s like starting a race with Usain Bolt and being shot in the foot at the starting line, **you have no hope of competing**.

I want you to think that if you are white, you’ve always *been* in power because it’s always been somebody who is white is in Power, it’s always been somebody white that’s passing the law for somebody that is white; the majority of the society, predominantly, as you know it, is catering to somebody that is white.

The mainstream caters to somebody that is white. The Tech industry, even though it’s been around for a short period of time, the internet’s only been around for the last thirty years, the majority of people who are at the higher level within the industry, are white. So, if you think about the generational wealth gap between somebody that has so much behind them, so much *influence*, so much *power*, behind them compared to a person that is black.

### The influence of white culture on the mainstream

It’s fascinating when you think about that, because the influence of all on somebody that is white and depiction of white culture in the mainstream compared to black culture within mainstream, there is a distinct gap between programs on TV that caters to somebody who’s from somebody that is from a non-white, minority background.

Plus, there is so much institutional prejudice that has arisen because of that. Bills were made into laws and you know all of these different parliaments that go through and the majority of people cater for people that look like them and it’s just the case where we’ve come to this, and somebody from black or minority, ethnic group is still fighting to have some type of equality and even within the Tech industry, we are *still* fighting to have that type of equality. This, if you think about it, is crazy. I mean, it’s 2020 are we *still* talking about this?! Because, yeah, we’re still talking about this and because we still *need* to talk about this, so?

Let’s talk about it.

### Nottingham Tech Scene
![Nottingham Tech Scene](/assets/img/posts/2020-tech-notts/nottingham-lrg.jpg "Nottingham Tech Scene")

The tech industry in Nottingham, would you consider it to be diverse? A lot of people would say, *yes, because we have a lot of of meet-ups, that, you know, cater for people from different areas of tech, and we have women in tech and we have loads of different projects that are ongoing, we have ProjectFunction, which is talking about helping somebody from underprivileged backgrounds towards coming into Tech, so we have lots of initiatives in place where we’re trying to get people from that type of cultures into the Tech industry, so Nottingham looks like we okay?* And to this, I would say: *you think so? let’s see*.

The tech industry in Nottingham, when somebody says *diverse*, most people when they talk about the tech industry being *diverse*, it’s all *about I’ve hired a white woman to fit this role and because we’ve hired two white women and we have 10 other white male that work in the office* we have a **diverse** business.

*We’re diverse!*, that’s what people say when they’re in Nottingham, and I’ve seen it myself. I’ve commented on it (you can see go check my Twitter feed, for a case where people of this mindset are talking about diversity). You have white females working in the tech industry but there’s not a Black female or Asian female, or somebody from a different minority, ethnic group. This is what I see as a black person looking in.

I’m looking for somebody that looks as a representation of me and yet, I cannot see that. I don’t see a white female as diverse, though she might be for somebody that is white, but she’s not diverse enough for somebody that is black.

Because the current reality is that, that’s what people call diverse when I don’t think they should. Because for me, even women in tech, I’m gonna say is mostly white women in tech, and it’s really bad to say that out loud but that’s what the truth is. It’s like if, you think about it, most people that get hired, and when you are getting hired, look like everybody else. I’ve been working in XYZ company and the majority of people that are working in the tech industry now, even in Nottingham, that has a multitude of mixed and diverse ethnic groups, being a mixed diverse city, the multitude of people that get hired into the industrial are white.  

How can we say we are making products and services and representing society within tech, if that is the case?


All powers to somebody that is hiring a female, I’m all for it, but I’m just thinking out loud that we could do better, we can do some more for other people from diverse ethnicities, as well.

### Tech Community vs Our Society.
![Tech Community vs Our Society](/assets/img/posts/2020-tech-notts/people-holding-their-phones.jpg "Tech Community vs Our Society")

Look at the tech community versus our society, look at the majority of kids born now are mixed race, my kids are mixed race, the majority of families that you see are all mixed; you have so many different cultures within the city but compare that to the tech industry within Nottingham.

I won’t show it but you can look look at the different companies and look at the people that work at these companies, look up their Instagram photos for their for their Christmas party, look up their Instagram posts for their for their team meetings where they show all of these Zoom call photos of the entire company, they’re predominantly white. That’s just what it is: **a tech industry that is contrary to what society is**. Diversity to me means having different opinions from different people of all shades, colour, and abilities. That’s what real diversity means.

### Ignorance is a real thing!
![Ignorance is a real thing!](/assets/img/posts/2020-tech-notts/people-standing-in-front-of-the-building.jpg "Ignorance is a real thing!")

Some people say you know you just ignorant and it’s the case where you know empathy you can empathise with somebody else and you can you can get similar feelings, you can understand where somebody’s coming from and I understand, a lot of people say *no I don’t see colour you know somebody white, somebody black it means nothing to me it’s all the same it’s all about the person and the individual it’s not about the colour of their skin* and I get that, I *get* that.

But rest assured, ignorance is a real thing, I mean there’s a certain level of knowledge you can never attain.

Example: I was born black, and I will never have knowledge of what it is like to be white. The opposite is also true: if you are a born white, you will never fully understand what it is to be black.

But how does one gain some understanding from somebody else? It is through having conversations, through asking, through researching, through learning. You might never be empathetic towards somebody if you don’t have a vested interest in that person to begin with

In order for you to have a vested interest, you have to have these conversations. We have to talk for you to know how I feel as a black man working in the tech industry. Plus, you have to talk to other people from other cultures for them to know where you are coming from, in order to try to make this a better industry we first have to start from the ground up.

### Look at things through different lenses.
![ook at things through different lenses](/assets/img/posts/2020-tech-notts/man-taking-photo-of-couple.jpg "Look at things through different lenses")

We need to be looking at things with different lenses, we need to invite diversity and inclusivity into our workplace in the tech industry. We need diversity and we need inclusivity. The tech industry needs people to help them look through different lenses in order to change the response to different problems we face because we have loads of problems that we go through on a day to day. Hence, it’s important that there are different people from different backgrounds, culture, ethnic groups involved in order to help to fix those issues.

The tech industry is booming at the minute. I mean look at it: Zoom is booming, E-commerce is booming, we are in a lock down and yet I’m here being able to do this talk where I’m trying to give you a point of view, because I’m working in the tech industry. But if we don’t have buy-in, if we don’t have the bye-in of everybody in the society, when feelings change and things move on and there’s no longer an appetite for it: **our industry will fail**.

The only way to guarantee that our industry doesn’t fail is that we need to have everybody and I mean everyone we need to have people from different cultures, different ethnic groups in the industry solving the problems that industry face in order to make it better and we need to be building a community that truly represents our society because these are the people that we are actually selling these product to, these are the people that we’re making products and services for, so should we not in theory have that representation within our workplaces?

### How can we do better?
![How can we do better?](/assets/img/posts/2020-tech-notts/men-wearing-crew-neck-t-shirt.jpg "How can we do better?")

You might ask yourself how can we do better, there was a saying folks used to say to me growing up and I firmly believe in it, **“it takes a community to raise a child”** and what that means is that we need to give a bit of our time and to invest in the industry.

What we need to be thinking about is saying to yourself **“we need to be planting these seeds, that we will never (I mean that!), we will *never* see become trees”**.

We need to be doing things that we don’t see the benefits from straight away, but long-term we know has the potential to bloom into something great and I will stomp it on for you.

### This is Mel.
![This is Mel](/assets/img/posts/2020-tech-notts/mel-and-her-daughter.jpg "This is Mel")

This is Mel and her daughter. Mel was introduced to me about an year and a half ago. She wanted to get into the tech industry. long story she was a college student she this is her second stint at college.

The first time she left because she became pregnant, she got married, and, you know, a lot of things happened. But kind of what drove her was the fact that she felt like she was in a situation where not a lot of people thought that she would have been able to become somebody.

She felt like the tech industry, web development is what she specialized in. It was something she could actually do, she had a quick brain, she felt like she could learn a lot, she was a bit rough around the edges but she felt like if she put the time, as she had read about a lot of people that were self-taught, she could get there. All she needed was a mentor to push her along, and that’s what she asked me to do.

Now the only thing I had to do was to give her one hour of my time on a week-to-week basis. I met up with her and I basically spoke to her about what she was working on, gave her critique, and told her how to do better. And then she came back, showed me how she did it better. It was ongoing, until she finished Uni and applied for a job. She got a job in the tech industry, at Adtrack.

This is Mel now, Mel has literally skyrocketed to the point now where she is in the industry mentoring others, telling them all how to get into the industry. It was something that she had dreamt of doing, and because she felt like she could it with a helping hand, she has achieved it. She’s at the point where she wants to do the same for other people. 

She’s working in the industry and her daughter looks up to her and copies her mom in everything she does. So, there’s a potential there for a daughter to become somebody in this industry because she sees her mom as a role model, as somebody that looks like *her*, somebody who is not just a white woman working in the tech industry but somebody from a minority ethic background; the possibility that her daughter could actually come and do the same thing her mom does.

And this is what I mean by *planting seeds that you will never see become tree*, the potential for her daughter to become something because of her mom doing it, is great! That’s what I think we need to do more of.

### Diversity is a cornerstone of winning teams

I’ll give you a scenario: you are asked to employ somebody. There are two candidates, one candidate (white), you have met before. You’re aware of that person’s work ethic and there’s some familiarity. The next person (black), has a good CV, good education but you’re not sure how they fit into your team culture.

Who do you hire?
This is the question. You know if the workplace was truly a representation of the society that you make products for, then your team meetings, your Christmas party, would look like what society looks like. But, it doesn’t. I say this because, I’ve looked at them. I’ve seen your Instagram posts, I’ve seen all of those Christmas parties, I’ve seen your all company calls, and you know what? The majority of people working in the tech industry are white, there’s a distinct shape of black and colour missing from these pictures that represent the industry.

For your company to have the best chance of winning, it should embrace diversity and inclusion. **“And as you embrace diversity and inclusion, approach it as a team sport. Talent acquisition should act like the backup point guard in basketball, or attacking midfielder in football, setting up and feeding teammates so they can succeed and more importantly, so the whole team can succeed.”** That was a quote from Rosana Durrutthy, she is the Vice President, Global Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging at LinkedIn and it’s quite striking because she’s Black.

I saw this interview that she gave in which she spoke about this, and posted a video of a little black girl hugging this female developer because the little girl could not believe Rosana was the head of this massive company and she looked just like her. Watching that video sent shockwaves through my body because it is so important for somebody that looks like me to be out here giving a talk because what it does is that somebody coming up can see or read *this* and feel like they can be a part of something that *I’m* a part of.

### Don’t Focus on visual appearance Focus on the agenda

That’s a quote from me, ask yourself who are your clients and customers, what do they look like, who sits in the office, who makes these websites, who makes these products, do they all look the same?

I have been personally told by someone that they treat everyone the same, and they “don’t see colour or race”. That person was white. My rebuttal is simple: if you could change your race to be black, would *you?* Do you really think there is *no* such thing as race or you just don’t *see* colour?


Having people in our industry with varied knowledge and varied points of view is *ideal* as it represents your society, market, and the world. Let people be who they are without fear of being marginalised. There is a severe lack of accessibility for Black and minority ethnic groups in the tech industry but there is no overwhelming concern, so it doesn’t affect the majority of people working in the industry. Why should it be somebody else’s lack of representation affects you personally when you never understand what it means to be black guess the same way I will never understand what it is to be white (why should it be somebody else’s lack of representation affect you personally when you can never understand what it means to be Black? The same way, I will never understand what it is to be white.)

Even if I don’t understand truly as I was not born white, the representation of what is to be white is overly-subscribed in our industry and our society at large. Do people know what white privilege is when you are accustomed to something *all* your life? Do you really see it as a privilege?

There is more than one way of being black and I’ll tell your story. I grew up in Jamaica where there were different shades of black. In Jamaica, the majority of the population would be considered to be black, but if your skin tone was lighter you were given preferential treatment and were seen as above others. When I was growing up, the Prime Minister looked like a white man but he was governing a country that was distinctly black. I never grew up thinking I could become the Prime Minister because that’s what I saw. That was in Jamaica, but somebody is saying to me that in England, where, predominantly, the population is white, “I do not see colour, everybody is the same”.

*I* see colour. Everybody is *not* the same.

There’s a lot that you don’t understand. A lot of people don’t understand what privileges are. You don’t lose your white privilege when you don’t understand what it is. I don’t want you to feel bad about being white the same I don’t want to feel uncomfortable for being black but I’m going to critique our industry as a part of my job because having somebody from a different point of view critiquing the work you do and showing your flaws in the position that you are, and giving you feedback, is a positive thing. It’s a good thing that will help to change this industry and this is why I’m doing this. I’m not critiquing you in a negative way, I’m critiquing you with a hope that this will bring about positive changes.

### Create &amp; Accelerate Opportunities
![Create &amp; Accelerate Opportunities](/assets/img/posts/2020-tech-notts/speaking-at-podium.jpg "Create &amp; Accelerate Opportunities")

Create opportunities and accelerate opportunities for others. We know white is the default mode but dark mode is sweet, it saves battery, it’s easier on the eyes at night. Having an option to switch is not a bad thing, being different is not a bad thing, it leads to discovering approaches and thinking outside the box from the default choice to solve problems.

Sacrificing something for a greater good is not a bad thing. It leads to enlightenment. Teach yourself above everyone else that is not white, there’s a tonne of literature. you can stop saying I don’t see colour, or there are no prejudices or there’s no racism that’s just you being ignorant and is because you don’t have a more diverse view of the world.

If you continue to look at the headlines or you continue to look at your social media feed or your YouTube algorithm, this is not the reality. In reality, the world is made up of different races and different individuals, with different beliefs, we all breathe the same air and use the resources the earth provides in order to live. It would be ideal for you to have some more conversations with somebody that is not just from your clique of people, that you go out with on a day-to-day, and not the same skin colour that you are, and understand *their* culture and *their* backgrounds and beliefs.

### Stories &amp; Drive
![Stories &amp; Drive](/assets/img/posts/2020-tech-notts/man-wearing-black.jpg "Stories &amp; Drive")

Stories and drive should be used to evaluate how someone fits your company agenda. Gender equality versus race equality is not what I am here for, I want to reiterate women in tech is great, but there are, there should, be some similar initiative towards having people from minority backgrounds in the tech industry as well. It's only fair that there should be some representation of different people of colour in order to be calling your workplace a diverse workplace. Look, being the only woman in an office surrounded by males is not ideal. Much like, being the only black female surrounded by male co-workers is not ideal. I’ll let you be the judge of which one you think is worse, though both make you feel isolated. Having offices that bring your culture forward and makes you feel comfortable

### Why are you not helping people?
![Why are you not helping people?](/assets/img/posts/2020-tech-notts/photo-of-people-holding-each-other-s-hands.jpg "Why are you not helping people?")

For people from underrepresented ethnic groups working in tech: you can’t play your diversity card, you’ve already been playing it. Represent your minority by showing up and taking part and asking for progression. Similarly, going into a place where someone who looks like you there is a comfort level already established; unspoken connection. Stop being so quiet, make some noise, get your level.

If you are a white and in a privileged position in your company, it is not enough to open the door and say, *well we can hire somebody that is from an ethnic minority*, you need to do more. Imagine somebody like me, imagine us, in *your* own shoes. Imagine one of us doing your job. Can you make that a reality?

### Try different approach.
![Try different approach](/assets/img/posts/2020-tech-notts/vr-lenses.jpg "Try different approach")

Try a different approach or go against the grain.

Giving somebody a job because they are given to you by a recruiter is just lazy. Do some research. Use another matrix, are people smart, Do they work hard? Are they humble? Are they a A player. In companies, you have many people that are married, do you have a matrix showing how many of them have children? Do you have a matrix showing how many own their own homes? These are stats that show how well you are treating people in your workplace. These are stats that show how comfortable people are in their jobs to be making these long term commitments.

You need to change the philosophy of the company. You shouldn’t be focusing on only profit.

If you are CEO of a company you should be asking yourself, can my staff do what I can do or can I make sure that my staff are given the same options that I am giving? A CEO should be a role model that every staff should be trying to attain.

What happens when you hire somebody that is from a minority ethnic group, what happens? Is it the case that black person is the only black person in that company so they have to start assimilating, acting like white guy to fit in the role.

If it’s a woman that you hire, does she have to become manly (“one of the boys”) to fit in, in the office.

What is the culture that drives your company? Having an office that brings your culture and gender forward and makes you feel comfortable, it’s what people should be looking for. That’s the type of workplaces that we should be creating for others.

If interviewing is done right, you will get somebody. You’ll get people that will help you and your business to achieve.

If you understand the opportunity, then why not this person from a Diverse Background that has the potential for more but, they are restrictions holding them back. Rather than hire someone that did it like that, try recognising talent in these places and giving them opportunities and giving them room as a company to let them achieve.

### Culture, Profit and Work
![Culture, Profit and Work](/assets/img/posts/2020-tech-notts/woman-wearing-black-and-red-gingham-sport-shirt.jpg "Culture, Profit and Work")

We should look at Culture, Profit, and Work as the Holy Trinity. These three things should not outweigh each other. Profit should drive culture, Culture should drive profit and work. All three should be balanced when making decisions and all three should have consistency behind them.

People need to start asking the question “why don’t we?” *rather* than “this is what we always do”. If you don’t like how things are being done, why not show people how to do the things the better way?

There are companies out there in Nottingham that make £10 million in profits a year but give four thousand pounds a year for Women In Tech to promote diversity in tech. There are companies out there that turn over £10 million in profits a year and they give zero to ProjectFunction to promote black and ethnic minorities in tech.

Find an office that brings your culture forward, being able to go to work and being able to put your music on Spotify, and being celebrated for it. That’s the type of office somebody from a mix and diverse background should be trying to get into.

### Core Vision &amp; Goals
![Core Vision &amp; Goals](/assets/img/posts/2020-tech-notts/woman-standing-while-carrying-laptop.jpg "Core Vision &amp; Goals")
Let’s talk about core vision and goals. Having a core vision and actually attaching change to that goal of improving diversity and inclusivity in your organization is the only way that you will achieve change. You could try removing the name, removing the location of a job (shouldn’t this be the *address of the applicant?*), removing the date of birth from an application thinking that you were removing bias. But I will guarantee you, as soon as a person moves into the next round of interviews where they have to do a face to face interview, and that person is being interviewed by somebody that is looking for somebody that looks like them, they **won’t** get the job.

Organizations are lazy. They don’t want to fix it because it’s just easier. *I have somebody that likes horse riding, I like the same things that they do, I look like them!* Organizations don’t want to surround themselves with people that don’t look like them because I think they might rock the boat. So, they look for something where everybody is identical, standing in a straight line.

Compare that to actually having a set goal that is coming from the top, from the CEO, saying they want more diversity. They want somebody from different backgrounds and cultures within their organization, and putting that as a core vision and a goal within the company so *everybody* is on that point, and *everybody* wants to do that.

### These are the things that we need to do in order to become better.

Our industry is a beautiful one. I work here and I would like to see my kids looking up to me and thinking they could possibly work here in the future. To be able to come into a tech industry and feel comfortable, feel like they are *included*, feel like they *can* go anywhere within the company. For there will always be a shortage of people that look like me in tech.

### Thank you

Thank you for watching, I really appreciate the time that you’ve spent. Now, I hope that this talk has left you with some enlightenment and maybe pushed you in some direction towards wanting some change and, hopefully, made you understand where I’m coming from as a black person within tech.
